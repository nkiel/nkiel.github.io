        I started building basic websites in 8th grade and quickly evolved to
        working with my High School's Robotics team. With that First Robotics(FRC) team
        I was able to expand my skills learning Java and C++. <br />
        While attending Iowa State Universitym, I have taken many classes to expand my knowledge
        and develop a breadth of skills that allow me to build a variety of applications and services.
        I have lots of knowledge on networking and securing it, as well as data processing with scala.
